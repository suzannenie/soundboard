## Project: Automated Soundboard
Users are able to input .wav files into a chosen sized soundboard, play them with their keyboard, add certain effects to their sounds, and record what they play. They can also make their inputted sounds into an automated default beat (or choose what sounds they want to input). Or they can create their own beat and use it as a template to generate a beat from different sounds from the board.
## Libraries Used
numpy, pyaudio, wave, time, threading, audioop, aubio, sox, pysndfx, random, math, copy, cmu_112_graphics, tkinter
